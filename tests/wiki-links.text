[[Wiki Link]] at point 8.

Here's a second link, an aliased link [[first|second]], at point 73.
The first two links are invalid.  This third link, [[inline]], is a
valid link since the file `inline.text` exists.  The last link is at
point 155.

Bracketed expressions in code blocks should not be matched as wiki
links:

```
{
 :user {
   :repositories [["clojars" {:sign-releases false}]]
   :plugins [
      [lein-cloverage "1.0.6"]
   ]
 }
}
```
